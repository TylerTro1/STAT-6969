    "This project spawned out of the interest in Assignment 5. I wanted to try new pre-processing methods, new models, and run cross validation for different hyperparameters. Once I tried to implement all of that manually, I found it highly tedious and figured it would be worthwhile to make a general function which searched over all combinations of pre-processing(s), model(s), and hyperparameter(s), returning the best combination on the given dataset (that is, yielding the best accuracy / F1-Score).
